## Example Gatsby site with UX Capture integration

This pakcage demonstrates how a Gatsby site can implement UX metrics instrumentation using [UX Capture library](https://github.com/meetup/ux-capture).

It uses a Gatsby UX Capture plugin ([`@meetup\gatsby-plugin-ux-capture`](https://github.com/meetup/ux-capture/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-ux-capture)) to set up integration (injects core UX Capture library into head tag and initializes it) and UX Capture React bindings ([`@meetup\react-ux-capture`](https://github.com/meetup/ux-capture/tree/master/packages/react-ux-capture)) to instrument individual views and elements on the page.
